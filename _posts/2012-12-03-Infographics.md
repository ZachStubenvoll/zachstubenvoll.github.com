    <h3>Web of Influence</h3>
    <p>The Web of Influence was one of the first major infographics targeting Romney's very entwined group of advisors. The infographic carried on the styling of the Jobs Chart by including the same framing and title treatment. Also, due to the content, this infographic was designed, approved and pushed out in a matter of hours.</p>
