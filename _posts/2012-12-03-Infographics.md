    <h3>Jobs Chart</h3>
    <p>I initially designed the jobs chart as a random project that was requested months before the release of the chart. It became the most shared image on Facebook at the time and was released on a monthly basis consisting of outputs created for Facebook, Twitter, the BarackObama.com Blog, Flickr, postcards, and was turned into a interactive chart based on the original design of the static jobs chart. The jobs chart also set the aesthetic tone and foundation for many infographics to follow.</p>

    <h3>Web of Influence</h3>
    <p>The Web of Influence was one of the first major infographics targeting Romney's very entwined group of advisors. The infographic carried on the styling of the Jobs Chart by including the same framing and title treatment. Also, due to the content, this infographic was designed, approved and pushed out in a matter of hours.</p>
