    <h3>Forward. Logo</h3>
    <p>Forward. was the official slogan of the 2012 Obama campaign. The one word slogan encompassed everything that was at stake with the 2012 election: Forward. Not Back.I designed the final logo with the Rising Sun as a nod to the accomplishments of the 2008 campaign, joined with the clean and stark look of the 2012 campaign. Eventually the logo was modified from Forward. to Forward! for the last weeks of the campaign.</p>
