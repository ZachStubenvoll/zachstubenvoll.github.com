    <h3>Forward. Logo</h3>
    <p>The 2012 the slogan of the Obama for America re-election campaign was Forward. The phrase encompassed exactly what the campaign was fighting forâ€”moving the country forward on all issues from economic to social issues. The logo was developed in a quick and time sensitive turn around with a group of designers doing the initial comps. I designed the final logo with the Rising Sun as a nod to the accomplishments of the 2008 campaign, with the clean and stark look of the 2012 campaign. The logo was used on everything from signage to merchandise. Eventually the logo was modified from Forward. to Forward! for the last weeks of the campaign.</p>
